    <h2 class="main-header">Hi, I’m Sangeetha</h2>
    <p class="content-text">A strong believer in user-centric design,
      I’m passionate about creating simple solutions for everyday problems.
      I love exploring the value of wild ideas and believe that there’s always room for improvement.
      With a background in Computer Science, I worked as a full stack developer
      for over 2 years and built data visualizations to help stadiums (Eagles, Florida Panthers)
      track their network performance.</p>
      <span style="margin-bottom:30px"></span>
      <p class="content-text">Currently, I am pursuing my graduate degree from the
      University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
      <span style="margin-bottom:30px"></span>
      <p class="content-text">In my free time, you’ll find me listening to music,
      reading or enjoying a long walk.</p>
      <span style="margin-bottom:30px"></span>
